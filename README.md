This is a script to scrape all the publically accessible images from a chosen wewbsite and is also designed to store the metadata for each image in a JSON file in the images.

The script will use Python3 and dependencies will need installing. If you are getting import module errors when running, make sure the required modules are installed properly and that Python and it's packages are saved in the Environmentals path (Windows)

Run the suitable install.sh file to check and install necessary Python and packages on Linux and Mac or user the install.bat file for Wwindows.

If you can't run batch files on your device, simply run pip install -r requirements.txt from the project directory.
